## Description

Client to interact with the Census Bureau API I built, [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/d-bryan/census-data-api).
This only implements two features from the API - Apportionment and Itemized Taxes by year for 2020. It creates a Choropleth
map of the US with the data from the API.
